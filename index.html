                The potential of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) in the world of cryptocurrency comparable to the problems they face. While DEXes are prevalent in many aspects of crypto, they are also the most underserved application due to the high level of requirements for reliability, scalability, and speed.
                <br><br>
                Historically, DEXes have succeeded despite the drawbacks of existing Layer 1 blockchains. However, Sei is a new sector-specific Layer 1 blockchain that has been optimized for trading.
                <br><br>
                Every aspect of the blockchain has been optimized to help exchanges run better and offer the best UX for their end users.
